Files worked with on 3/29/16 
/home/voegtlylj/MouseData/HiSeq_150630_2X100/FASTQ/Project_MichaelKiflezghi/Sample_C1
From here we took R1 (left hand) and R2(right hand) and will run joint fastqc in galaxy

In order to upload these large files to galaxy we need to upload to FTP server first and then we can run fastqc joiner from there. This is how you upload ftp files. http://screencast.g2.bx.psu.edu/quickie_17_ftp_upload/flow.html 
Basically what we did was open up filezilla (server is main.g2.bx.psu.edu, user is alkhairohr@vcu.edu, password is riveraisdope) and dragged and dropped files.
